# AMR-SIM

**AMR-SIM** is an AI-powered simulation tool for planning and testing Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) systems in warehouse environments. It helps pre-sales engineers and warehouse planners simulate different scenarios to meet specific throughput goals, robot types, and layout configurations.

> ðŸš§ This project is still in progress â€” currently focused on building core features like throughput configuration, dynamic map layout, and algorithm selection.
